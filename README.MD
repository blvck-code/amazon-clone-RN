# Amazon Clone React Native

## Introduction

This project is a UI clone to Amazon Ecommerce Mobile App

## Requirements

1. node_js 16+

## Installation pre-requisites

For this project, we recommend installing Node 16 Long Term Support Edition(LTE)

To easily switch between node versions on your machine, we recommend using a node virtual environment tool such as nave or nvm-windows, depending on your operating system.

For example, here is how you switch to a new node version using nave:

    # note that you don't even need to update your node version before installing nave
    npm install -g nave

    nave use 12.3.1
    node -v
    v12.3.1

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the expo-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

    npm install -g expo/cli

# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/blvck-code/amazon-clone-RN.git

After cloning the repo, next you install npm on the project directory using the below commands on your terminal:

    cd amazon-clone-RN
    npm install

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, try re-installing the node js again.

# To run the Mobile App

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npx expo start or expo start

Scan the QR code with your phone and download the Expo CLI to interact with the mobile app
